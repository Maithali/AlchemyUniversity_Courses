/*
Let's create an object representing a pizza order!

In the order object, add the following three keys with values accordingly:

    pizzas - Any number greater than zero.
    extraCheese - A boolean. Either true or false.
    deliveryInstructions - Any string of instructions.

    Feel free to get creative with these values! So long as the values are the approriate type, the test cases will pass!
*/
const order = {
    pizzas:10,
    extraCheese:true,
    deliveryInstructions : "Give it to the Guard",
};

module.exports = order;
