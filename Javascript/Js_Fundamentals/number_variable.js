 Your Goal: Store Number in a

    Your goal on this stage is to simply give the variable a some number value.
        It could be any number. Perhaps it's your favorite number, maybe it's a floating point number 12.5 or perhaps it's a negative number -22! It's all up to you. You'll do this by typing a number on the right-hand side of the const a = statement.
    Once you have set the number, click "Run Tests" to move forward!
